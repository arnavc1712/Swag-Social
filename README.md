# Swag-Social

The primary motivation behind SwagSocial is to provide an easy and efficient way to deal with problems that a normal citizen faces on a day to day basis. These concerns can be flooding, potholes, vandalism, assaults, and others. At the same time, we believed that providing a direct method of communication to the authorities can make necessary actions taken quicker.

This was my Hacktech 2020 submission.
